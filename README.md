### Notes
I ran into a problem around the collectionView point. My build was failing due to something not connecting properly. I rewatched the video and I was able to solve it. I am also running into problems with github. Pushing/Committing is a bit challenging because I am using a public Mac, so I think I may have to buy a personal Mac later.

### Notes
One challenge I faced during Flix part 1 was with installing cocoapods. I used a public Mac Computer so I did not have administrative access when installing cocoapods via the terminal. I then used the alternate way to install cocoapods (without sudo), but I could not install cocoapods still. I then transferred to a different Mac computer and was able to install cocoapods successfully.
